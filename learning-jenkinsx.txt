everything has changed in last 5 years
    premise - to - cloud
    vms - to - containers
    monolithic - to - micorservices
    high performance team via ci/cd 
    
    kubernates is defacto standerd in scaling and managing all these
    
Challenges for new groups
    setup cloud / kebernates and environments
    move to containers
    deploy containers to kubernates
    adopt ci and cd 
    automate everything
    keep delivering actual business to customers

    gitOps is new way of managing all the configurations with their commit history , so if any thing goes wrong just pull back 

and here only the jenkins X help us with in getting rid of all these issues 
    - automates the installation , configurations and upgrade of jenkins and other apps like help (package manager for kubernates ), skaffold , nexus , monocular
    -automate ci/cd 
    - uses gitOps to manage promotions between environments
            testing- staging - production
    - lots of feedbacks via commenting on pushes 

How do we setup kubernates with jenkins X
    
    install the command line tool : jx
        https://jenkins-x.io/getting-started/install/
    follow the steps for the jenkins X installation on ubuntu machine
        to get help about the available jenkins X commands type in console 
            jx
        
    to install minishift , follow the last section 
    it will take time have patience
    

    facing issues in this approach 
===================================================================

another approach :
    
    install first the oracle Virtual Box :
        sudo apt install virtualbox
        or follow any other link 
    
    install minishift locally first by executing the below commands:
        download the minishift zipped version :
            wget https://github.com/minishift/minishift/releases/download/v1.33.0/minishift-1.33.0-linux-amd64.tgz
        unzip the downloaded files
            tar xvzf minishift-1.33.0-linux-amd64.tgz
        go to the directory
            cd minishift-1.33.0-linux-amd64
        put the minishift binaries in the path 
            sudo mv minishift /usr/local/bin
        set the default virtual box to use the minishift
            minishift config set --global vm-driver virtualbox
        start minishift and check its working fine or not
            minishift start
        type the below command to allow oc commands
            eval $(minishift oc-env)  
        then log in as admin 
            oc login -u system:admin

    install jenkins-X locally by following the below link (for linux) :
        https://jenkins-x.io/getting-started/install/ 
    
    Note : dont use the ( jx install cluster minishift ) command as we already have minishift installed , in place of this we will start with the 
        jx install 
    now just wait it will take at least 2 hrs minimum to install all the things.
    
    once all setup is done , we will start with a project creation 
        create a spring boot basic project with this command: 
            jx create spring -d web -d actuator
        it will prompt for some info, feed it and then it will create the repo in your 
            home/USERNAME/NAMEOFTHEPROJECT
