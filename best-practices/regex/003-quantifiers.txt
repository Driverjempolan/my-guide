"quantifiers" help you to say how many times something should be matched

The first one is the question mark, which makes the previous token in the expression (the previous character or group of characters) optional.

Eg:
    The expression /regexp?/ will match both "regex" and "regexp", 
    as the question mark makes the p (but only the p) optional.

Exercise:
    Write an expression that will match both "frontend" and "front-end", and give it as an argument to the answer() function (eg answer(/your expression/)).

    Sol:
        (/front-?end/)
