The following characters need escaping in regular expressions:
    $   (   )   *   +   .   ?   [   ^   |   ]
    if we will not put a escape character they will not be accepted .

To escape them, we use a backslash, 
    eg
    this will not work :
    /what?/ 
    but this will
    /what\?/

The dot character has a special meaning in regular expressions: it matches any single character except for new line characters (so /a.c/ would match "abc", "a c", "a$c", etc). 

Exercise:
    String num="12345";
    
    write a regex expression to find a match for 3.5

Sol:
    num.match(/3.5/)
    o/p:    ["345"] wrong
    num.match(/3\.5/)
    o/p:    null right
