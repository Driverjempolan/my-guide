bio: some file name against we have to match.
match: method with which we are going to match the certain String condition

eg:
    bio.match(/juggernaut/);

Note: whatever String we have to match will go inside / /  , as it tells that here our regex starts

another ways to match are :
    /juggernaut/.exec(bio)
    and
    /juggernaut/.test(bio)

.replace() method of a string to replace a bit of a string with another string:
    bio.replace(/juggernaut/, '[ashu]')
