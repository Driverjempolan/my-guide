Write a java program to check if a given number is a prime number or not. Use Jexl for expression evaluation

Given a method with a HashMap as input. Write code to find out average of all values whose keys are even numbers. Round the average to two decimal places and return as output. Use Jexl for checking if the keys are even numbers

    Input= {1:2.3,2:4.1,6:6.2}
    Output= (4.1+6.2)/2=10.3/2=5.15
