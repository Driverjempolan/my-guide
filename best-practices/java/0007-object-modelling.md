## Java Object Modelling: Part 1

**Objective: Start developing Java Object-oriented Modelling Capabilities**

    1.you are expected to model the requirements.
    2.you are expected to present the design and dummy/skeleton code of their class.
    3.Solution of each activity should be executable with basic print statements to track control flow.

**Activity 1:**

    Model a pub where a user should be able to order foods and drinks. 
    A server takes order from a user and accordingly notifies the bartender and chef. 
    Once ready, the server serves the order.
    On taking order, the server should verify the legal drinking age if the order comprise of alcoholic drinks. 
    A manager in the restaurant assigns server to take orders.

**Activity 2:**

    We need a recipe app where users can publish receipes. 
    A user should be able to create a new Recipe and add Ingredients to it. 
    Users should also be able to specify the amount of igredients to be used in the recipe.

**Activity 3:**

    Model an online cab booking system. 
    A user should be able to book cabs (regular, premium, luxury) if free. 
    Once booked, the driver should be able to start the trip. 
    The cab won't be available for booking until the driver ends the trip. 
    In between booking and starting a trip, the user can cancel the trip.
    On completion of a trip, the user should be able to view the trip invoice. 
    A user and driver can both provide feedbacks to each another.
