// let name;
// console.log(name);

// output : undefined
// explaination : by default the variables in js are undefined and we have to initialise them

// lets see now 

let name ='ashu';
console.log(name);

// output : ashu
// Note we can use single or double quotes to define string in js , but single quotes are more preffered.


// rules for naming variables:
// cannot be a reserved keyword
// should be meaningful 
// cannot start with a number (ex 1name is not allowed)
// cannot contain a space or hyphen
